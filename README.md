## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Recovery

### Dry Run Mode
Always test with dry run mode first! This shows you exactly what would happen without actually moving files.

### Undo Functionality NEW!
Every organization operation creates an undo log (`undo_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`) containing:
- Source file paths
- Destination file paths  
- Timestamps
- Operation details

**Standalone Undo Tool**: Use `undo_organizer.py` to reverse any organization:
```bash
# Quick undo (will prompt for confirmation)
python undo_organizer.py

# Auto-confirm undo (for automation)
python undo_organizer.py --yes
```

The undo tool automatically:
-  Finds all undo log files  
-  Shows operation details and timestamps
-  Restores files to original locations
-  Cleans up empty organized folders
-  Provides detailed progress feedback

**Perfect for:**
- Testing different organization rules
- Reversing accidental organization  
- Trying the tool risk-free
- Batch operations with confidence

### Error Handling
The application gracefully handles:
- Permission errors
- Missing files/folders
- Disk space issues
- Network drive problems

## Pro Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Test on a small folder first
2. **Use Dry Run**: Always preview changes before organizing
3. **Keep Undo Logs**: Save undo logs until you're happy with organization
4. **Test with Undo**: Try organizing ‚Üí undo ‚Üí adjust rules ‚Üí organize again
5. **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of important files
6. **Review Rules**: Check organization rules match your needs
7. **Clean Regularly**: Run organization weekly/monthly

### Power User Features
- **Batch Processing**: Organize multiple folders by running multiple times
- **Automation**: Use CLI mode in scripts for automatic organization
- **Custom Categories**: Edit config.ini to add new file types
- **Date Formats**: Customize how date-based folders are named

### Performance Tips
- Close other applications when organizing large folders
- Organize from local drives (not network drives) for best speed
- Use SSD drives for faster file operations

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

** Files not organizing as expected**
- Check file extensions in the Rules tab
- Verify source and destination paths
- Ensure you have write permissions

** Application won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
- Check if `tkinter` is available (usually included with Python)
- Try command line mode: `python file_organizer.py --cli`

** Permission errors**
- Run as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/macOS)
- Check folder permissions
- Ensure destination folder is writable

** Slow performance**
- Organize smaller batches of files
- Close other applications
- Use local drives instead of network drives

** Undo not working**
- Check if undo log file exists (`undo_log_*.json`)
- Verify files are still in organized locations
- Ensure you have write permissions to original folders
- Try running with `python undo_organizer.py --yes` for automated mode

** Want to test safely**
- Use dry run mode first: Check "Dry run" in GUI
- Keep undo logs: Don't delete `undo_log_*.json` files
- Try on small folder first, then undo to verify everything works
- Backup important files before first use

### Getting Help
1. Check this README thoroughly
2. Review the config.ini file for customization options
3. Try dry run mode to debug issues
4. Check the generated undo logs for operation details

## Complete Example Workflow

**Scenario**: You have 1,000+ files in your Downloads folder and want to organize them safely.

### Step 1: Download & Setup
```bash
# Download the organizer  
git clone <repository-url>
cd file-organizer

# Make executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x *.py *.sh
```

# In the GUI:
#  Check "Dry run" option
#  Source: /home/username/Downloads (or browse to select)
#  Destination: /home/username/Organized Files (or browse to select)  
#  Click "Start Organizing"
#  Review the preview - no files actually moved yet!
```

### Step 3: Real Organization
```bash
# Uncheck "Dry run" and run again
#  Files are now organized into categories
#  Undo log automatically created: undo_log_20241225_143022.json
```

### Step 4: Verify Results
```bash
# Check your organized files
ls "~/Organized Files"
# Should show: Images/ Documents/ Audio/ Video/ Development/ etc.

# Check specific categories
ls "~/Organized Files/Images"
# Should show year folders like: 2023/ 2024/
```

### Step 5: Undo if Needed
```bash
# Don't like the result? Undo it!
python undo_organizer.py

# Output:
#  File Organizer Undo Tool

#   1. undo_log_20241225_143022.json (2024-12-25 14:30:22, 2.1MB)
# 
# Loading undo log...
# Found 1,247 operations to undo
# Undo 1,247 file operations? (y/N): y
# 
# [Progress bar showing files being restored...]
#  Successfully restored: 1,247
#  Undo completed successfully!
```

### Step 6: Perfect Your Setup
```bash
# Edit organization rules if needed
nano config.ini

# Try again with new settings
